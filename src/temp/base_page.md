Introduction
============

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

* **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [components](/docs/concepts/) and [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/).
  Use [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture/#langgraph) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
* **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
* **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related
technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with
hundreds of providers. See the [integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/) page for
more.

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.

Architecture[‚Äã](#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")
------------------------------------------------------------

The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the
[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture/) page.

* **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.
* **Integration packages** (e.g. `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
* **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
* **`langchain-community`**: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
* **`langgraph`**: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features. See [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

Guides[‚Äã](#guides "Direct link to Guides")

### [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)[‚Äã](#tutorials "Direct link to tutorials")

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our [tutorials section](/docs/tutorials/).
This is the best place to get started.

These are the best ones to get started with:

* [Build a Simple LLM Application](/docs/tutorials/llm_chain/)
* [Build a Chatbot](/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)
* [Build an Agent](/docs/tutorials/agents/)
* [Introduction to LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/)

Explore the full list of LangChain tutorials [here](/docs/tutorials/), and check out other [LangGraph tutorials here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/). To learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, *Introduction to LangGraph*, available [here](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).

### [How-to guides](/docs/how_to/)[‚Äã](#how-to-guides "Direct link to how-to-guides")

[Here](/docs/how_to/) you‚Äôll find short answers to ‚ÄúHow do I‚Ä¶.?‚Äù types of questions.
These how-to guides don‚Äôt cover topics in depth ‚Äì you‚Äôll find that material in the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/) and the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).
However, these guides will help you quickly accomplish common tasks using [chat models](/docs/how_to/#chat-models),
[vector stores](/docs/how_to/#vector-stores), and other common LangChain components.

Check out [LangGraph-specific how-tos here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/).

### [Conceptual guide](/docs/concepts/)[‚Äã](#conceptual-guide "Direct link to conceptual-guide")

Introductions to all the key parts of LangChain you‚Äôll need to know! [Here](/docs/concepts/) you'll find high level explanations of all LangChain concepts.

### [Integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/)[‚Äã](#integrations "Direct link to integrations")

LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.
If you're looking to get up and running quickly with [chat models](/docs/integrations/chat/), [vector stores](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/),
or other LangChain components from a specific provider, check out our growing list of [integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/).

### [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/)[‚Äã](#api-reference "Direct link to api-reference")
